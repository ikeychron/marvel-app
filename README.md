# Marvel App ðŸš€

This app is a test project made for the purpose of displaying Marvel characters and movies. It features a home page where users can look at their favorite movies, a character page with detailed information about the marvel's characters, and a modal with information about the selected character when you do click in a character. It is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Context, Atomic Design, and it fetches data from the Marvel API and The Movie DB API. The app also includes end-to-end tests using Cypress.

## Getting Started

To run the app, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Create a `.env` file and write your public Marvel API key as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARVEL_PUBLIC_API_KEY=yourapikey` and your private Marvel API Key as `MARVEL_PRIVATE_API_KEY=yourapikey`, and your The Movie DB API key as `TMDMOVIE_API_KEY=yourapikey` for when you start the server.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
5. The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The app will fetch the data from the Marvel API and The Movie DB API and display the results. To view more details about a character, click on the corresponding card.

## End-to-End Tests

The app includes end-to-end tests using Cypress to ensure that the user flow works correctly. To run the tests, use `npm run cy:run` or `npm run cy:open`. The tests should run simultaneously with the Next.js development server.

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to a hosting service such as Vercel or Netlify. To deploy the app, follow these steps:

1. Create a production build by running `npm run build`.
2. Install a server such as `serve` by running `npm install -g serve`.
3. Start the server by running `serve -s out`.
4. The app should be available at `http://localhost:5000` or the specified port number.
